# Front-End Interview Test

      npm install -> npm run serve 

In my implementation for this test I have chosen to use React. 
I love this framework and It's simplicity.
I think it gives a straight-forward way to deal with DOM manipulations and dynamic changes to it. 

for styling I chose 'styled-components', a library I love because I think it keeps the code clean and undestandable. further more, It gives a way to handle dynamic styling using javescript in the css code. 

### App flow: 
* Once main component mounts, It fetches the data from the given api.

* During fethcing a spinner is displayed. 

* Once data is fetched successfully the component re-renders and now a 'property' component is created for each property in the properties array stored in the state.
